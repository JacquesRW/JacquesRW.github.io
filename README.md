## Chess
Projects started over the course of writing chess engines:
- [akimbo](https://github.com/JacquesRW/akimbo) - UCI compatible chess and chess960 engine.
- [tuner](https://github.com/JacquesRW/tuner) - Generic framework used to tune evaluation parameters via various optimisation methods.
- [perft](https://github.com/JacquesRW/perft) - Basic implementations of move generation for various board representations.
- [Kimbo](https://github.com/JacquesRW/Kimbo) - My first UCI compatible chess engine.

## Sixth Form
Two group web development projects undertaken with my friends at sixth form:
- [Kimberly College Prom](https://github.com/Kimberley-College/Prom) - Website to facilitate sale and managing of tickets to our college prom, using React.
- [British Physics Olympiad Computational Challenge](https://github.com/Kimberley-College/BPhO-Website) - Calculating and displaying atmospheric data based on a simple model, using React and powering computations using WebAssembly on the client side.
